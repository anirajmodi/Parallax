            <p class="text">
                Adventure is the experience of some exciting activities. It is the unusual experience which comes from the activities full of courage, excitement and joy. It never thinks about the result. It may result positively which gives some benefits and negatively which hurts and make losses. However, adventurous people never mind the result and continue their adventure. Adventure exists in everything however it differs in the peopleâ€™s mind. Adventurous people think about the adventure as a new chance and opportunity to go ahead and get success or experiences through failure however coward people take it as a fearful act and never try to do.
                <br><br>
                Bold people do adventure always in their life. They suppose adventure to do anything in their life. We can experience adventure everywhere like getting birth, first day of school, interfere with first class teacher first time, going to tour at some adventurous places, participate in some adventurous sports, games, taking dive in the swimming pool from high height and so many activities. Doing adventure in the life may be risky to a great extent however it may also bless with blessings of success.

            <p class="text">
                Bicycle touring is the taking of self-contained cycling trips for pleasure, adventure or autonomy rather than sport, commuting or exercise. Bicycle touring can range from single-day trips to extended travels spanning weeks or months. Tours may be planned by the participant or organized by a tourism business, local club or organization, or a charity as a fund-raising venture.
                <br><br>
                Cycle touring beyond the range of a day trip may need a bike capable of carrying heavy loads. Although many different bicycles can be used, specialist touring bikes are built to carry appropriate loads and to be ridden more comfortably over long distances. A typical bicycle would have a longer wheelbase for stability and heel clearance, frame fittings for front and rear pannier racks, additional water bottle mounts, frame fittings for front and rear mudguards/fenders, a broader range of gearing to cope with the increased weight, and touring tires which are wider to provide more comfort on backroads.

            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                <br><br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                <h2 class="desc"> SURFING</h2>
            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                <br><br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
